# Salon-Appointment-Scheduler
This is an exercise made from FreeCodeCamp.org to train bash script and SQL

For this project, I created an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for a salon.

## 📁 Files
&emsp;| --> salon.sh<br>
&emsp;| --> salon.sql<br>

Among the files present in the root of the project are defined:
- <b>salon.sh<b>: bash script that works as the customers' and appointments' tracker, and interactively adds information in the database.
- <b>salon.sql<b>: script to configure the database with its tables and respectively columns and rows.
